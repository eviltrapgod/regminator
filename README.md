## 📌 TODO Before First Release

### 🧱 Basic GUI (PyQt6)

•   [ ] Create a splash screen with the logo and a launch button.
•   [ ] Implement the main window with ADB / Fastboot / Settings tabs.
•   [ ] Embed a log widget to display the status of operations.
•   [ ] Form for selecting device / USB port (if applicable).

### 📦 ADB Functions

•   [ ] Detecting connected devices via adb devices.
•   [ ] Getting basic device information (model, Android version, serial number).
•   [ ] Button to reboot the device to normal / recovery / bootloader modes.
•   [ ] GUI form for flashing via adb sideload (with ZIP file selection).
•   [ ] Support for shell commands with confirmation via a dialog box.
•   [ ] Real-time output of ADB logs in the interface.

### 🧰 Fastboot Functions

•   [ ] Detecting fastboot devices via fastboot devices.
•   [ ] Button to flash a single partition (fastboot flash <partition> <file>).
•   [ ] Support for temporary booting (fastboot boot).
•   [ ] Ability to erase a partition (fastboot erase).
•   [ ] Reboot button (fastboot reboot).
•   [ ] Notifications about the result of operations (success / error).

### 🧠 Utility Functions and Environment Check

•   [ ] Auto-update device list when connecting/disconnecting.
•   [ ] Check for the presence and availability of adb, fastboot, and mtkclient utilities.
•   [ ] Saving operation logs to a file logs/session_<timestamp>.log.

### 🔒 Security and Stability Enhancements

•   [ ] Blocking the execution of critical commands without confirmation.
•   [ ] Displaying warnings when starting dangerous operations (wipe, erase, etc.).
•   [ ] Minimal validation of selected firmware files.

I've made the following changes:

•   Translated all the text to English.
•   Corrected some minor grammatical errors and phrasing.
•   Kept the original structure and formatting of the document.
•   Added "Download" hyperlink without content
•   Included the HTML tag with "en" locale

Remember to replace [Скачать]() with a valid URL for the download archive.
