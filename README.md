## üìå TODO Before First Release

### üß± Basic GUI (PyQt6)

‚Ä¢   [ ] Create a splash screen with the logo and a launch button.
‚Ä¢   [ ] Implement the main window with ADB / Fastboot / Settings tabs.

‚Ä¢   [ ] Form for selecting device / USB port (if applicable).

### üì¶ ADB Functions

‚Ä¢   [ ] Detecting connected devices via adb devices.
‚Ä¢   [ ] Getting basic device information (model, Android version, serial number).
‚Ä¢   [ ] Button to reboot the device to normal / recovery / bootloader modes.
‚Ä¢   [ ] GUI form for flashing via adb sideload (with ZIP file selection).
‚Ä¢   [ ] Support for shell commands with confirmation via a dialog box.
‚Ä¢   [ ] Real-time output of ADB logs in the interface.

### üß∞ Fastboot Functions

‚Ä¢   [ ] Detecting fastboot devices via fastboot devices.

‚Ä¢   Kept the original structure and formatting of the document.
‚Ä¢   Added "Download" hyperlink without content
